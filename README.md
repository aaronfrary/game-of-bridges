Bridges
=======

Bridges is a logic puzzle played on a rectangular grid of any size. Each puzzle
is defined by its configuration of "islands" - grid cells each with an assigned
capacity between 1 and 8 inclusive. A player must draw "bridges" between the
islands such that the following criteria are met:

- Bridges run only perpendicularly and do not cross.
- At most two bridges connect a pair of islands.
- The number of bridges connected to each island exactly matches the number on
  that island.
- Each island can be reached from any other following a path over the bridges.

Implemented in (mostly) pure functional Clojure - side effects are limited to
the draw functions.

Installation
------------

Builds with [leiningen] (http://leiningen.org). I'll include a download link
once the project is ready for the world.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

- Step-by-step puzzle solver that can give a hint for the next move or solve a
  whole puzzle.
